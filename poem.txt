I've prepared a new edition of the book of Du Fu translations, which you can buy by clicking on the cover (right).
The book contains all four texts of each poem (simplified Chinese, pinyin, gloss and translation).
The printing from the new publisher (lulu) is good quality, and larger pages compared to the previous edition allow improvements in the layout - most poems fit on to two facing pages for comparison of the texts.
It costs Â£7.99 (currently just over $12), and lulu deliver more or less worldwide. Most of the changes from the previous edition are corrections of errors, a few more notes, and more cross-referencing with other translations.
